# Data Visualizations

Welcome to my repository of things I want to see graphed! Most everything here is from my life, or Reddit, which composes a larger part of my life than I'd care to admit.

Here's a quick overview of the projects. Enter the projects directory for a more in depth explanation!

**Battery Degradation** - Just a graph of the health of my laptop's battery and the warranty expiration period.

**BuildAPC History** - A deep dive into the history and trends of the computer builders from the /r/buildapc subreddit.

**Fridge Power** - I kept track of every occurrence the fridge and freezer door were opened for 100 days, as well as the fridge's power usage. How did I keep track? What did I learn? You'll have to dive into the folder to find out!

**Reddit Salary** - There was a salary transparency thread posted to the /r/rva subreddit. I wanted to know what the salary distribution looked like, so I pulled every comment from that thread and graphed the salaries.
