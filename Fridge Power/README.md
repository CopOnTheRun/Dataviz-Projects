Some graphs that I created after tracking how often and for how long the fridge and freezer were open over a 100 day period.

Here's one tracking every time I opened the fridge over that period, grouped by day of the week and time of day.

Yet another graph, this one showing how long the fridge or freezer was open each time they were opened.

Here's one showing the **cumulative** amount of time the fridge was opened per day.

Here's one with a comparison of how long the door was opened vs the cost (at $.14/kWh)
