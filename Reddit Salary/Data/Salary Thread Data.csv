Edit: Thing I want to comment on about my job - I did NOT go to school for engineering. I went to school to be an architect - the building kind. After a couple years making \~35k I decided to do some cheap night school programs (for around 10k total, but all borrowed as student loans) and break in at the ground level as a QA analyst. I made 100k within 5 years of starting. Anyone that wants to do my job and puts the time in can - and if you think you want to, step one is *just do it*:

It is important to note that the hospitals pay directly to the traveling company, who in turn pays the tech. Hospitals pay upwards of $125 per hour to the company. Meanwhile, full or part time employees working the same jobs are being paid less than half of travellers. Most people want to go into the traveling field because of this. It is a vicious cycle. Fun fact: VCU currently employs roughly 2,600 travelers. If hospitals would give their FT/PT employees a ~$15/hr pay increase they could retain and attract employees, give people what they deserve and save the hospitals millions of dollars. This could trickle down to lower hospital bills (although I know that part is a joke here in the USA). Sorry for the rant, it just infuriates me."
